# Abstract
This report delivers a detailed examination of Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) stock data through the lens of advanced time series analysis techniques, aiming to forecast the stock's future performance over a 6 to 12-month horizon. A stock is a share of ownership in a corporation, and an investment in TSLA stock represents a stake in Tesla's prospective achievements. The potential for capital gains and dividends comes with the inherent risk of price depreciation, reflecting the volatile nature of the stock market.

The core of this analysis is the application of various time series forecasting methods to TSLA's historical stock data. We begin with elementary models such as the Naïve method, which assumes the most recent stock price as the best predictor for future prices, and the Historical Average method, which forecasts future values based on the historical average of the stock. To gauge the precision of these methods, we employ accuracy metrics including Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), which collectively offer a quantifiable measure of each method's forecasting reliability for TSLA stock.

Moving beyond foundational approaches, the study incorporates more sophisticated models such as ARIMA and SARIMA, which are designed to capture complex patterns in time series data. The ARIMA model addresses non-seasonal time series data, while SARIMA extends this approach to account for seasonal variations, which can be particularly pertinent for TSLA stock given its historical performance patterns.

The report meticulously evaluates the results of these models, providing an in-depth narrative on the nature of TSLA’s stock behavior and the effectiveness of different time series methodologies. Our aim is to provide a nuanced understanding of TSLA’s price trajectory, empowering investors with the knowledge to make well-informed decisions in a market that is as promising as it is unpredictable.
